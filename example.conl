# CONL is a post-minimalist, human-centric configuration language.

# There are four ways to define a value:
scalar = value

list
  = value1
  = value2

map
  key1 = value1
  key2 = value2

multiline_scalar = """
  value

# For multiline scalars, you can specify a tag for syntax highlighting.
init_script = """bash
  #!/bin/bash

  echo "hello world"

# There is no quoting. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
# but keys and values can contain any characters (*conditions apply)
spaced out key = value with = signs

# To make it safe to include URLs as values, # is only a comment
# at the start of a line, after whitespace, or after the first =
# sign on a line.
a = https://example.com#a # jump to section a

# But the space around the = sign is purely for readability
short=16 bits

# It is possible to nest lists and maps as needed.
# (and as in JSON, types can be mixed however you want)
